# API Return Types
## Upload Object
Either all fields will be present, or all fields will be `null`.

URL for this upload is `<api-url>/uploads/<id>.<extension>`

It is somewhatttt guaranteed that this upload will be available in the wg it is referenced in. Uploads can't be moved and are only ever locked to the wg they are created for...
But this is not *strictly* enforced... 
Usually, only Receits require authentication, since wgs/users are [publicly acessible](#public-wg-endpoints)

- `id`: Integer
- `extension`: String -> Length: max 5
- `original_filename`: String -> Length: max 200 
- `size_kb`: Integer

## Intimate User Object
"Intimate" Representation of the logged-in user.
The intimate representation is only shown to your yourself.
It maps exactly onto the `users` Table in the database, though the password hash is redacted.
- `id`: Integer
- `username`: String -> Length: max 40, alphanumeric-_ 
- `name`: String -> Length: max 200
- `bio`: String
- `password_hash`: String -> Always `"<Not Provided>"`
- `revoke_before`: DateTime in RFC3339 Format (example: `"2019-10-12T07:20:50.52Z"`)
- `profile_pic`: Integer (id of [Upload](#upload-object)) or null 
- `wg`: Integer (id of [WG](#wg-object)) or null

## (Regular) User Object
"Regular" Representation of a User inside a WG
Usually, the Client should know for which WG this User is being retrieved
- `id`: Integer
- `username`: String -> Length: max 40, alphanumeric-_
- `name`: String -> Length: max 200
- `bio`: String
- `profile_pic`: [Upload](#upload-object) or null

## WG Object
Maps exactly onto the `wgs` Table in the Database
- `id`: Integer
- `url`: String -> Length: max 40, alphanumeric-_
- `name`: String -> Length: max 200
- `description`: String
- `profile_pic`: [Upload](#upload-object) or null
- `header_pic`: [Upload](#upload-object) or null

## Cost Object
Maps exactly onto the `costs` Table in the Database, except for the last three fields, which are only aggregated in the Query to get this Object.
- `id`: Integer,
- `wg_id` : Integer (id of [WG](#wg-object))
- `name`: String
- `amount`: (Decimal) Number as **String**!!
- `creditor_id`: Integer (id of [User](#intimate-user-object))
- `added_on`: DateTime in RFC3339 Format (example: `"2019-10-12T07:20:50.52Z"`
- `equal_balances`: Integer (id of Balance) or null
- `receit`: [Upload](#upload-object) or null
- `my_share`: [Share](#cost-share-object) or null
- `nr_shares`: Integer (theoretically 64bit!)
- `nr_unpaid_shares`: Integer (theoretically 64bit!)

## Cost Share Object
Maps exactly onto the `cost_shares` Table in the Database.
If this Share Object is returned as part of a different Object:
Then either all fields will be present, or all fields will be `null`.
- `cost_id`: Integer (id of [Cost](#cost-object)), 
- `debtor_id`: Integer (id of [User](#intimate-user-object)),
- `paid`: Boolean
