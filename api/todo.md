# Backend Todo
- impl actix_web::error:ResponseError for sqlx::Error  âœ”
    - proper DB error handling, not just ctrl+v "Database quirked up :(" ðŸ¤¡ âœ”
- add FromRequest for WGIdentity (requires WG) âœ”
- DELETE cost âœ”

- continue refactoring backend: balance and stats
- Add cost_shares.amount field, and update POST cost (and in future POST shares) accordingly, to guard that all shares add up exactly to costs.amount
- The result will allow for far more flexible and inexpensive querying of data

- Register User + create WG
- Send invite link to create user for existing wg
- Change Password Route
- **POST** `/my_wg/costs` with multipart/form attatchment endpoint
- Rethink mulipart/formdata implementation, that shits crusty afff

- Scaling Options maybe, worker threads or smth
